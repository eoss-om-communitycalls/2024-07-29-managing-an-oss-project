We know that some of these items are substantial, resource-heavy requests for an open science community and we don’t intend that this is a comprehensive list of topics, nor a limiting one.\nThe topics contained in the first version of this document reflect only what we discussed on the CZI EOSS community call. We encourage suggestions and contributions to expand the scope of issues that open source project leaders should consider when managing a project, as well as resources that would be helpful to leaders and their projects.\nFundraising\nDeveloping and Maintaining the Project\nMarketing the Project\nFurther reading: rOpenSci’s “Marketing Ideas for Your Package”\nManaging the Project at Scale (Governance)"

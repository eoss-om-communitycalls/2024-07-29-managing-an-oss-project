# 2024-07-29-managing-an-oss-project

This repository contains a checklist of issues for open source software project leaders, project staff, and project community members to consider at various stages of project evolution. 

The resource was first created by attendees of the July 29, 2024 Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software (EOSS) program community call, then developed further with the help of the broader EOSS community. This resource is intended to be a conversation-starter; we know that some of these items are substantial, resource-heavy requests for an open science community and we donâ€™t intend that this is a comprehensive list of topics, nor a limiting one. 

We encourage suggestions and contributions to expand the scope of issues that open source project leaders should consider when managing a project, as well as resources that would be helpful to leaders and their projects.

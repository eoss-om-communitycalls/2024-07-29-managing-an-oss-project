This resource is intended to be a conversation-starter for open source software project leaders, their collaborators, staff, and community. We know that some of these items are substantial, resource-heavy requests for an open science community and we don’t intend that this is a comprehensive list of topics, nor a limiting one. 

*The topics contained in the first version of this document reflect only [what we discussed on the CZI EOSS community call](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aQaVlPM1042w3H2cOeRq8I4FRkilxe9Znv6QeJfHv0Y/edit\#heading=h.qh9h2wf9gxuc). We encourage suggestions and contributions to expand the scope of issues that open source project leaders should consider when managing a project, as well as resources that would be helpful to leaders and their projects.*

**Fundraising**

- [ ] I have explored and chosen/developed an organizational structure(s) for the project  
  - [ ] Nonprofit   
  - [ ] Fiscally sponsored  
  - [ ] Cooperative  
  - [ ] Government Institute  
  - [ ] For-profit \- Company, LLC / Inc   
  - [ ] University project  
  - [ ] Using my personal checking account  
  - [ ] I have no idea yet, but have begun learning about these models  
- [ ] I have considered potential tax implications for me and the people I work with around the above fiscal model  
- [ ] If applicable, I have considered the relationship(s) of the project to my home organization(s) (e.g., lab in a university, project within an institute)  
  - [ ] I have formalized this relationship in writing  
- [ ] My project has a statement about transparently sharing finances, funding allocations, and the decision making process in an ongoing wayfunding cycles and the possibility of funding cuts/increases with community members

**Developing and Maintaining  the Project**

- [ ] Our project has contributor's resources, which:  
  - [ ] Invite contributions both code and non-code (e.g., documentation, user support, training) contributions  
  - [ ] Invite contributions from individuals of all skill levels and backgrounds, whether they involve code, technical writing, mentoring, localization or other types of contributions.  
  - [ ] Outline what acceptable contributions look like  
  - [ ] Explain any obligations associated with contributions (e.g., best efforts to support contributed code, including what happens when multiple contributions interact in a way that leads to problems)  
  - [ ] Invite structured engagement methods before to prepare contributors for submitting contributions  
  - [ ] Motivate and encourage contributors to share ownership and governance of the project  
  - [ ] Details potential equitable access models to financial resources and incentives for substantive contributions  
  - [ ] Details about how sunsetting / simplification decisions are made across the project  
  - [ ] Details about how breaking changes / deprecation are communicated and enacted, with a means for community input during the process  
- [ ] Our project has a development roadmap  
  - [ ] This roadmap is used and referred to in the context of project planning and development priorities  
  - [ ] There are clearly documented procedures for how additions/removals to/from the roadmap are considered and discussed

**Marketing the Project**

- [ ] We have a marketing and communications plan, and it includes:  
  - [ ] Conferences (in-person and/or virtual)  
  - [ ] Video Content (YouTube, etc)   
  - [ ] Events  
  - [ ] Social media  
  - [ ] Academic publications / pre-prints about the software and possibly results created with it, including s  
  - [ ] Submission to JOSS or another venue for software papers  
  - [ ] Invited talks  
  - [ ] Online information sessions  
  - [ ] Training events / tutorials, perhaps at events where potential users gather  
  - [ ] Hackathons  
  - [ ] Community calls / meetups   
  - [ ] Synchronous communications means (slack, gitter, discord etc)  
  - [ ] Asynchronous communications (mailing list, github issues, community forum)  
  - [ ] A periodic newsletter  
    - [ ] Weekly  
    - [ ] Monthly  
    - [ ] Quarterly  
    - [ ] Per Release  
- [ ] Our documentation suggests how our project should be cited in publications and requests that users do this  
- [ ] As our community grows, we’ve got a plan to distribute the load of “marketing” across the project, not expecting that one person “does” all the marketing  
- [ ] We’ve talked to users of our software to understand how **they** use our software  
  - [ ] We’ve published example use cases online  
- [ ] As a project, we’re considering how our marketing needs may change and evolve and how we can encourage our community to conduct informal marketing on the project’s behalf. To support this we’ve created:  
  - [ ] Short one/two page colorful collateral about the project  
  - [ ] Informative presentation slides   
  - [ ] Easily findable and accessible vector logos  
  - [ ] Communication guides for community members  
  - [ ] Ways to get involved / contribute

**Managing the Project at Scale (Governance)**

- [ ] We have identified the stakeholders responsible for prioritizing tasks, both technical and social  
  - [ ] We have developed and documented a process for agreeing to development goals and setting progress milestones   
    - [ ] This process is transparent and accessible to the community  
    - [ ] Outcomes of the process are communicated to the broader community  
  - [ ] We have identified incentives to encourage contributors and maintainers to work toward these priorities  
  - [ ] We have decided or have a process for deciding which parts of the project will and will not receive maintenance  
- [ ] We have decided and communicated what the project “never will be” \- i.e., we have scoped down and communicated the technical goals of the project  
- [ ] We have developed a project governance structure  
  - [ ] The governance structure is published and accessible  
  - [ ] We have discussed and set goals for how the governance structures may evolve as the project grows  
    - [ ] We have identified benchmarks or measures that are relevant to our community to signal that governance changes may be needed (e.g., low community participation in decision processes; retirements or career changes of key personnel)  
  - [ ] We have discussed whether or not the project would benefit from an advisory board  
    - [ ] We have developed plans for involving the community in designing and selecting the board  
  - [ ] Further reading: [Center for Open-Source Research Software Stewardship and Advancement (CORSA) governance resources](https://github.com/corsa-center/oss-documents/?tab=readme-ov-file\#governance)  
- [ ] We are prepared to manage conflict in our project  
  - [ ] We have installed processes for identifying conflict as it occurs (e.g., in online spaces or in-person)   
  - [ ] We have a project Code of Conduct  
    - [ ] The reporting process is sufficiently explained and accessible  
    - [ ] We have delegated responsibility for fielding reports and ensuring they are addressed, with appropriate training and resources provided to those responsible  
- [ ] We have considered and implemented ways to avoid burnout among key contributors and maintainers, including by asking for input from the community  
- [ ] There are clear, traversable pathways for users to move to contributors, contributors to move to maintainers, community members to take leadership positions, and other role transitions  
  - [ ] We have listed or illustrated the skills necessary to move between these roles  
  - [ ] We have strived to make these pathways accessible to all
